# Logging

- Q. Why is traceability _so_ important?
- A. A system must be able to empirically show that the core operations are reproduceable in a controlled environment.
    - a.k.a. if you're going to build sand castles at high-tide, you better be able to build a sand castle in a sandbox, or you're just wasting your time.


# Defining _traceability_
- A clearly defined particular quantity that has been measured
- A complete description of the measurement system or working standard used to perform the measurement
- A state measurement which includes a documented uncertainty
- A complete specification of the reference at the time the measurement system or working standard was compared to it
- An _internal measurement assurance_ program for establishing the status of the measurement system or working standard at all times pertinent to the claim of traceability
- An _internal measurement assurance_ program for establishing the status of the specified reference at the time that the measurement system or working standard was compared to it.

- An _internal measurement assurance program_ may be quite simple or very complex, the level or rigor to be determined depending on the level of uncertainty at issue and what is needed to demonstrate its credibility. Users of a measurement result are responsible for determining what is adequate to meet their needs.
